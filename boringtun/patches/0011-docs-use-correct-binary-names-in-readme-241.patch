 As per the specification, to start a tunnel use:
 
-`boringtun [-f/--foreground] INTERFACE-NAME`
+`boringtun-cli [-f/--foreground] INTERFACE-NAME`
 
 The tunnel can then be configured using [wg](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg.8), as a regular WireGuard tunnel, or any other tool.
 
 It is also possible to use with [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `boringtun`. For example:
 
-`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=boringtun WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`
+`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=boringtun-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`
