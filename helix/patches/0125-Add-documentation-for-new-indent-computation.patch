+By default, Helix uses the `hybrid` indentation heuristic. This means that
+indent queries are not used to compute the expected absolute indentation of a
+line but rather the expected difference in indentation between the new and an
+already existing line. This difference is then added to the actual indentation
+of the already existing line. Since this makes errors in the indent queries
